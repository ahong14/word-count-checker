# word-count-checker
ECS 60 Data Structures and Algorithms Course Project
Worked with a partner to implement the project. 


Execute gen.out with a text file as a command line input.
Output of the program lists all words within the file, number
of occurrences, and line number appearance. 

All data structures such as BinarySearchTree.h/.cpp were provided
by instructor. Our task was to modifiy the class templates to 
perform what we needed.
